## My First Slide

Some text to go on the slide, even though you really should use very little text, and mostly images, when giving a talk.

<div class='notes'>
There shouldn't be so much text
</div>

## This is Awesome

Woooooo!!!

<div class='notes'>
This is the greatest way to make a slideshow
</div>

## Plot

```{r diamonds-plot,fig.align='center',message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x=price)) + geom_histogram()
```

<div class='notes'>
- histogram
- diamond prices
- we should really set the number of bins
</div>
